# Coding Exercise ITS 150
# the bits of code that you need to complete are the 
# variables in the code assigned to 0 

# This is our example vector (don't change this)
years &lt;- c(2008,2009,2010,2011,2012,2013, "YEAR")

# Extract the underlying data type of the vector years
# and store it in a variable called type_years
type_years = 0

# Extract the class data type of the vector years
# and store it in a variable called class_type_years
class_type_years = 0

# Test if the vector years is of a numeric class type 
# and store the result in a variable is_numeric
is_numeric  = 0s
